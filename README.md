Our project aims to develop a Code Complexity Measuring Tool that assists software developers in evaluating the complexity of their codebases. By analysing various metrics such as code size, type, the nesting level of control structures, inheritance, and recursion, the tool provides detailed measurements using charts and tables, and assigns a grade. Using this tool allows developers to refactor, optimise, download their code, and identify basic code errors.Code Complexity Measuring Tool.
